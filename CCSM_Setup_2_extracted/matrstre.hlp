Matrix strength

The Budiansky-Fleck model of unnotched strength assumes plastic microbuckling. Initiation of failure is controlled by fibre waviness and the shear strength of the matrix. The matrix strength can be estimated from the yield strength of the unidirectional composite in shear. Typical values for polymer matrices are in the range 30 - 100 MPa.

Refer to the review paper "Compressive Failure of Fibre Composites" by NA Fleck, Advances in Applied Mechanics, Vol. 34, Academic Press, ed. JW Hutchinson and TY Wu, pp 43-118 (1997), for a further discussion, and practical ways of estimating matrix yield strength.
