Equivalent Holes  -  Modelling of post-impact compressive strength

When loaded in uniaxial compression, damage propagates from regions of delamination (e.g. arising from impacts) in a similar way to that observed with open holes. Further details, in particular describing how to estimate the diameter of this equivalent hole, are given in the following reference, "Prediction of the post-impact compressive strength of CFRP laminated composites", by C Soutis and PT Curtis, Composites Science and Technology, Vol. 56 (1996), pp 677-684.
