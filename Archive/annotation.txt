I've created a basic simulation framework that includes:
Material properties class with:
Orthotropic properties (E_axial, E_transverse)
Shear modulus, Poisson's ratio
Density and cost
Damping properties
Geometry class with:
Length, diameter, wall thickness
Calculated properties (area, moment of inertia, volume)
Main simulation class with methods for:
Axial stress calculation
Bending stress calculation
Natural frequency analysis (up to 3 modes)
Damping analysis
Visualization of stress distribution
Frequency response analysis
To run the simulation:
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script: python fork_simulation.py
The example uses carbon fiber properties, but you can easily modify the material properties and geometry in the if __name__ == "__main__": block.
The script will generate:
Basic properties (mass, cost, natural frequency)
A stress distribution plot showing axial, bending, and total stress
A frequency response plot showing the fork's response to dynamic loading
You can modify the forces, geometry, and material properties to see how they affect the fork's behavior. Want to try different parameters or add more analysis features?
