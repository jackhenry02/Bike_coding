Fibre Waviness

The Budiansky-Fleck model of unnotched strength assumes plastic microbuckling. Initiation of failure is controlled by fibre imperfections in the form of fibre waviness. Existing models use a single representative value of fibre waviness, typically around 2-3 degrees for CFRP laminates.
Further work aims to model the more complex problem with distributions of waviness throughout the composite.

Refer to the review paper "Compressive Failure of Fibre Composites" by NA Fleck, Advances in Applied Mechanics, Vol. 34, Academic Press, ed. JW Hutchinson and TY Wu, pp 43-118 (1997), for a further discussion, and practical ways of estimating fibre waviness.
