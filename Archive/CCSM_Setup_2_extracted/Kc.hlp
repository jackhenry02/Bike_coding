Microbuckle toughness

The Fleck-Soutis model of notched strength assumes a microbuckle and associated delamination damage grows from the edge of a sharp notch or hole. The resistance to damage can be modelled using the unnotched strength and a compressive 'fracture toughness'. The fracture toughness Kc is measured using centre-notched coupon specimens. Typical values for CFRP composites are in the range 40 - 50 Mpa sqrt m.
