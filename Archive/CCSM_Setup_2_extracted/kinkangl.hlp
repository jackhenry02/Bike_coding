Microbuckle kink propagation angle

The Budiansky-Fleck model of unnotched strength assumes plastic microbuckling. Microbuckles propagate across the specimen at a fixed orientation to the direction of the 0 degree fibres. Typically this 'beta' angle lies between 20 and 30 degrees.

Refer to the review paper "Compressive Failure of Fibre Composites" by NA Fleck, Advances in Applied Mechanics, Vol. 34, Academic Press, ed. JW Hutchinson and TY Wu, pp 43-118 (1997), for a further discussion and to "Microbuckle propagation in fibre composites" by MPF Sutcliffe and NA Fleck, Acta Metallurgica and Materialia, 1997, pp921-932 for theoretical predictions of the propagation direction.
