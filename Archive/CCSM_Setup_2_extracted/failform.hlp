Using the failure form

In this form the failure of the laminate is predicted. As well as conventional failure criteria, the Budiansky-Fleck-Soutis criteria for compressive failure of unnotched and notched laminates is included. 

After choosing your failure criterion, ply data should first be entered in the appropriate data boxes. Where the failure strengths are the same for each ply, click the Save Data - All Plies button. For a laminate made up of different materials, individual strength data for each ply can be entered using the Save Data - This Ply button. The strength of each ply can be examined by clicking and navigating through the ply arrangement table.

For the BFS compressive failure criterion, the variation of notched strength with plate geometry can be calculated. Further information on the BFS criterion are available with the ? help buttons and in the manual.
