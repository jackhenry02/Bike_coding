# SC2 Bike Design: Computer modelling of bike components to explore the
viability of flax-carbon hybrid composites

Welcome to my project, it is quite messing but below are the key files:

In bash, using "source setup.sh" to set up a virtual environment and install the requirements.

Key Files:
- composite_theory.ipynb : Explains theory of custom composite layup software
- composite_design.ipynb : Contains carpet plots for different composites, (as well as some other unfinished design work)
- simulation.ipynb : some initial approximated analysis of properties, and histograms of effective properties
- examples folder : Contains plots made from 'homopy' library on Halpin-Tsai and Mori-Tanaka, 2 micromechanics models
- composipy and docs : unused here, but this is a library for simulating composite plate buckling
